This blog is all about me, things that keep me busy, and especially things that I forget if I don't write them down!  
  
Who I am?  
A creature that has to get along on this planet, a nerd, a gamer, a cyclist and from time to time a normal person.  
  
*Enjoy the journey and throw kindness around like confetti!*
